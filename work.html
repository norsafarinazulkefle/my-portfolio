After that, i;m quited from there because i need to continued my study.
Then, while waiting for my STPM result i'm also has been working at ECO Shop as a Cashier
But after 3 months, i'm quited from there because i want go to my Aunty house at Selayang
Because too long stay at my aunty house, i'll try to find a job at there.
So i got the job at 7Eleven near my aunty house
And, after 2 months, i've got the UPU result.
So, i'm quited again from 7Eleven and decided go back at my hometown.
what i want to say is, i've learned how to make money by myself without burden my parents. So this experience teached me how to be independent.</p></h1></center>
